Description: General tools for exploratory process data analysis. Process data refers to the data describing
    participants' problem solving processes in computer-based assessments. It is often recorded in computer
    log files. This package provides two action sequence generators and implements two automatic feature extraction methods that compress the information
    stored in process data, which often has a nonstandard format, into standard numerical vectors. This package
    also provides recurrent neural network based models that relate response processes with other binary or 
    scale variables of interest. The functions that involve training and evaluating neural networks are wrappers
    of functions in 'keras'.
